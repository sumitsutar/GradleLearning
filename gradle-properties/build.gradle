>>>>>>>> We have seen that objects can have different attributes in 'properties' project of this module. But you can also have define your properties as a key value pair just like in java. 
>>>>>>>> The properties file can be placed at root folder and that's all. Gradle does an amazing job of importing this properties file. 
>>>>>>>> Please bear in mind - 'It is a best practice to check if the property exist before using it. For this you can use hasProperty() method.   
>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>> For example We will create a file under this project and see if we can access it in this file as well as in the root level build.gradle as well. 
>>>>>>>> STEP -1 : Create a file viz. gradle-properties/gradle.properties
>>>>>>>> STEP -2 : create a properties with viz. 'movie:Avengers and greatestAvenger:Tony Stark' in gradle-properties/gradle.properties
>>>>>>>> STEP -3 : read properties from gradle-properties/gradle.properties in this build.gradle
>>>>>>>> STEP -4 : read properties from gradle-properties/gradle.properties in root level build.gradle
